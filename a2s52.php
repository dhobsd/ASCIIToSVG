 *    objects from a cache file.
 *
 *  * If this file doesn't exist, can't be read, or the mtime has
 *    changed, we scan the directory and update files that have changed
 *    based on their mtime.
 *
 *  * We attempt to save our cache in a temporary directory. It's volatile
 *    but also requires no configuration.
 *
 * We could do a bit better by utilizing APC's shared memory storage, which
 * would help greatly when running on a server.
